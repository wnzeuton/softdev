k37 notes:
sudo apt update
and install python, venv, and other essentials
we faced a weird daemon screen asking us which services should be installed, we just went with yes
make a project directory and venv into it
within venv, install wheel, uwsgi, and flask
make basic app
you have to allow your server ip to forward port 5000, otherwise it goes to your nginx site without said port
uwsgi runs a flask app, or similarly
configure project.ini and make a project.sock for sockets
creating a systemd unit file will allow Ubuntu to auto start uwsgi to run a flask app
configure project.service to communicate nginx to backend flask/uwsgi
specifically the environment has quotations and "PATH=" in the service file
give www-data chgrp perms
start with sudo systemctl start project
boot with sudo systemctl enable project
we don't need a domain name, but make the server listen to the location and ip
ln -s didn't cause us any issues
you have to unblock the site by default
use unlink
