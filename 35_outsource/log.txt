K35 -- Conversing with Copilot
2025-03-14
time spent: 2

DISCO:

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...

q0: Very many; too many; required manual edits
q1: Caught few but significant errors. Noticed via terminal error messages and standard debugging processes. We either fixed ourselves or informed CoPilot.
q2: HTML Templates are quite similar, general process is similar. CoPilot was much more modular than our solutions.

trouble remembering instructions
likes to add auxiliary python libraries that were not asked for
seemingly big preference for sqlalchemy
used deprecated function at first
flask running but cannot access app through local port???
paused on me bruh
basic syntax deteriorating over time????
after some prodding and manual editorializing, success!
