    Users will have to register to use the site.
    A logged-in user will be able to
        Create a new blog
        Update their blog by adding a new entry
        View and edit their own past entries
        View the blogs of other users

Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework.
SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system. 

Multiple Python files should be used, as necessary, for application layer. (a.k.a. "middleware" modules, etc.)

Use this struture:

app/
    __init__.py
    templates/

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Let's start by setting up the Flask project structure and implementing the core features as outlined in the plan.
Step 1: Set up Flask project structure

    Create a new directory for the project.
    Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for templates, static files, and the main application (app).

The final structure should look like this:

Step 2: Implement core features

    Create a Flask app instance in the main application directory.
    Set up the SQLite3 database configuration and models for users and blogs.
    Create routes and view functions for user registration, blog creation, updating, and viewing.

Let's create the necessary files step by step:

HTML Templates

We will create the following HTML templates inside the app/templates directory:

    base.html
    register.html
    login.html
    create_blog.html
    view_blog.html
    edit_blog.html

Here's a basic example of the base.html template:

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Here are the HTML file templates for the blog site:

These templates should cover the registration, login, blog creation, blog viewing, and blog editing functionalities. You can further customize the HTML and CSS to match your desired design.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

dont use sqlalchemy, just use sqlite3

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Sure, I'll adjust the code to use SQLite3 directly. Here are the updated files:
Python Files:
app/__init__.py

HTML Templates:
app/templates/base.html
app/templates/register.html
app/templates/login.html
app/templates/create_blog.html
app/templates/view_blog.html

how do i run this

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

To run the Flask application, follow these steps:
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

    Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    sh

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:
    sh

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
sh

    source venv/bin/activate

Install Flask and other dependencies:
sh

    pip install flask flask-login bcrypt

Step 2: Create Directory Structure and Files

    Create the project directory structure as outlined previously:
    Code

    project/
        app/
            __init__.py
            models.py
            routes.py
            templates/
                base.html
                register.html
                login.html
                create_blog.html
                view_blog.html
                edit_blog.html
        instance/
            config.py
        run.py

    Copy the provided content for each file into the respective files in your project directory.

Step 3: Initialize the Database

    Ensure the instance directory exists:
    sh

mkdir instance

Run the application to initialize the database:
sh

    python run.py

    This will create the instance/site.db SQLite database file and initialize it with the necessary tables.

Step 4: Run the Flask Application

    Run the application:
    sh

    python run.py

    Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Step 5: Interact with the Application

    Register a new user by navigating to /register.
    Log in with the newly created user credentials at /login.
    Create, view, edit, and delete blogs after logging in.

Summary of Commands
sh

# Step 1: Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-login bcrypt

# Step 3: Initialize the database
mkdir instance
python run.py

# Step 4: Run the application
python run.py

Example Usage

    Register: http://127.0.0.1:5000/register
    Login: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
    Home: http://127.0.0.1:5000/home
    Create Blog: http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog/new

This setup should allow you to run and interact with the Flask application as intended. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'before_first_request'. Did you mean: '_got_first_request'?

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The before_first_request decorator has been deprecated in Flask. To resolve this issue, you should initialize the database directly in the application startup code. Here's how you can modify your app/__init__.py to initialize the database correctly.
Updated app/__init__.py
1 vulnerability detected

Make sure to remove the @app.before_first_request decorator and the corresponding function from app/routes.py.
Updated app/routes.py
Public code references from 7 repositories

With these changes, the application should initialize the database correctly and avoid the AttributeError. You can now run your application using the same steps as before.

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

the routes aren't working, i'm getting error 404

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

To troubleshoot the 404 error, let's check a few things:

    Ensure that the routes.py file is correctly importing the Flask app instance.
    Make sure that the routes are correctly defined and registered with the Flask app instance.
    Verify that the templates and URLs are correctly referenced in the HTML files and the routes.

Let's update the structure and ensure everything is correctly set up.
Updated app/__init__.py

Updated app/routes.py

Updated run.py

Make sure your project structure is correct and all files are in place.
