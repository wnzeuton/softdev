## K15: Take & Give
### Due: 2024-10-09w before class

Your Trio Mission: 

_Step 0: Come together. "Form like Voltron." Learn each others' names. Introduce Duckies, fetch KtS..._

__Write a Flask app__ to echo to a site visitor their input via an HTML form. Use provided code as starting point.

Your app's response should be
* visible to your visitor as a rendered page in the browser,
* produced via template,
* include username entered,
* include request method used,
* include your greeting to this person, and
* showcase your clearest breakdown of the differences between a GET and POST request (generalizations welcome, but give treatment specifically to handling these in the context of a Flask app, using the shared codebase you all started from)

Also:
  - Display team name and roster on landing page and response page.

<br>

Specifications/Guidelines:
  - Use Q&A forum liberally.
  - *Simplicity is divine.*
  - Note anything notable in `notes.txt` in app's root directory.
  - _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in your html and python files.
<br>

DELIVERABLES:
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
* Save to workshop as indicated.
