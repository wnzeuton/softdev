## K20: Bootstrap From the Foundation on up, with a Tailwind...
### Due: 2024-11-15f before class

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

#### Your MISSION: 
As a duo, look up your assigned front-end framework.
* Research your framework.
* Create a single html page that demonstrates the key features of your framework. 
  - It should not be too complicated; you do not need to showcase every feature in the framework. 
  - Highlight the most attractive/useful features of your framework.
  - Your page should provide a simpler on-ramp than the site from which you learned.
* Upload your example (and any necessary framework files) to the workshop.
* Title your directory `20_framework-abbreviation _teamName_lastaF-lastbF`
  - (e.g., `20_bt_indigoGirls_rayA-saliersE`)
  - (e.g., `20_fd_runTheJewels_melineJ-renderM`)
  - (e.g., `20_tw_trolls_statlerA-waldorfB`)

Specifications/Guidelines:
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* Comment liberally in-line. Speak to your future self and/or teammates.
* _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in all source files.
