## K18: Serving Looks
### Due: 2024-10-17r before class

Your Trio Mission: 

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

<br>

As a trio, refactor:
* a visit to your site should yield the same view/content as last work, but...
* ...it will be served by a live flask web server.


<br>

Specifications/Guidelines:
  - Use Q&A forum liberally.
  - *Simplicity is divine.*
  - *Never stray far from runnable code.* (keep your flask server running!)
  - Note anything notable in readme in app's root directory.
  - _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in all source files.
<br>

DELIVERABLES:
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
* Save to workshop as indicated.
