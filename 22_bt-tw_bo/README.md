q1
Tailwind due to its inline styling, flexibility and utility classes, making it easier to achieve the aesthetic with less styling CSS.

Notes
Both websites use a red theme for demonstration
Tailwind allowed quicker prototyping with a simpler structure 
Bootstrap required more CSS overrides

QCC
Use developer tools to change styles especially when blind testing with tailwind or bootstrap
With tailwind, simplify and stick to default style whenever possible
