Got jinja error: BedRequestKeyError, username does not exist

After added ?username, we were directed to a different page.
This tells us that to make a request you have to add ?[var] to the web address.

This is verified by the statements output in the terminal.

After submitting our username from the login page, it says username =
[whatver we submit into the input box]&sub1=Submit+Query

We can see that the request object is universal across the script,
and can be called by any function and will share the same arguments/values.

Upon further inspection, we realize that 'username' can only be called because
the form in login.html passes the input value under the name 'username'. When
we replaced that to 'user', we observed that the address changed to
auth/user=blahblahblah and we received an error telling us that 'username' was
nowhere to be found. Changing 'username' to 'user' in the /auth section of
app.py would likely resolve this issue and give us the same result as 
we originally had with all values being 'username'.
