Got jinja error: BedRequestKeyError, username does not exist

After added ?username, we were directed to a different page.
This tells us that to make a request you have to add ?[var] to the web address.

This is verified by the statements output in the terminal.

After submitting our username from the login page, it says username =
[whatver we submit into the input box]&sub1=Submit+Query

We can see that the request object is universal across the script,
and can be called by any function and will share the same arguments/values.
