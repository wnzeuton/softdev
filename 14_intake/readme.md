## K14: Who Do Forms Work For?
### Due: 2024-10-08t before class


Your Trio Mission:

_Step 0: Awaken Duckies, remember names, designate driver..._

1. Save today's care package locally.
1. As a squad, read entire codebase for understanding. Take notes as you go.
1. Verbalize a plan to proceed.
1. Proceed. Note anything notable as you de/reconstruct today's code.
  - Q: Is it runnable with all the commented-out lines re-enabled? If not, why/how?
1. If confident in progress so far, grow codebase to echo user input to the page displayed after form submission.

Guidelines:
  - Note anything notable in `notes.txt` in app's root directory. 
  - _PLAN FIRST_ so as to maximize your valuable time. Re-use code where possible. (Do not carry forward garbage...)
  - _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in your html and python files.
